# Architecture

This is the architecture of the implementation: the classes and glue that make it, the dependency rules they follow, and the complete module index. It is subordinate to [the design](design.md): the design decides intended behavior, this repository's code realizes part of it, and [status](status.md) records the gaps. Where this document or the behavior it describes conflicts with the design, the design wins — fix the implementation or record the gap, and do not weaken the design. Start with the runtime and Engine, then use the Modules table as a code index.

## Core classes and glue

Core classes own domain concepts and external boundaries behind small interfaces. Glue translates tool arguments, HTTP requests, Source payloads and DeepSeek Harness events into calls to those classes, then turns results into cards, views and messages.

`Runtime` (`src/app/runtime.ts`) constructs the application, supplies dependencies, and owns startup and shutdown. `Engine` constructs its own internal parts. The Executor and Assessor call back into the Engine, so Runtime gives them getters rather than requiring construction in a circular order.

### Runtime

`Runtime` is the composition root; it contains no domain rules. Its constructor locks the state directory, opens the Store and builds each component. If construction fails, it closes the Store and releases the lock.

Startup registers management routes and runs Setup. After setup resolves, it installs Session and Executor hooks, ensures the main Session exists, starts Policy syncs, resumes interrupted Assignments, and starts passes and effects. `ready` marks completion of startup.

Shutdown cancels turns, waits for passes, effects and agents, releases Worker environment bindings, closes the Store and releases the lock. No process-wide environment is installed or restored. Source plugins inject Runtime as the `orchestrator` service through the narrow `SourceHost` interface.

| Part | Module | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | `src/app/setup.ts` | Probes each Source instance's repository/account independently and keeps per-instance readiness and problems; checks changed connections before a save and resolves immutable snapshot accounts once, without changing the process environment |
| Environments | `src/app/environments.ts` | Offers bounded Source-specific execution choices, checks selection/revision/availability and repository compatibility, binds Tickets to immutable snapshots, and resolves pinned local execution inputs |
| Passes | `src/app/passes.ts` | One pass at a time, every two seconds and whenever a command asks: the due effects, then `Engine.evaluateDue`; a Source's Trigger reaches the Engine through it |
| Outbox | `src/app/outbox.ts` | The Engine's `Outbox` port, and the only writer of the receipts: `send` keeps a message's receipt and queues its `reply` effect in one transaction, and the effect's handler sends it through `SourceRegistry.send`; a message waits while its Source is off, and is dropped when the conversation is gone or not listened to |
| Notices | `src/app/notices.ts` | Converts domain events and worker activity into main-Session messages. `eventNotice` handles domain notices; `reportRelay` forwards questions immediately, keeps ordinary progress on its Ticket, and relays other reports; `followupRelay` names the Tickets that own a human follow-up. Relays arriving during a turn are delivered together at its next step through the DeepSeek Harness inbox |

### Engine

`Engine` (`src/core/engine.ts`) is the only writer of Triggers, Threads, Decisions, Tickets and Assignments. It receives these ports from `src/core/ports.ts`: `Repositories`, a current-Policy getter, `SourceScope`, `Assessor`, `Executor` and `Outbox`. Optional dependencies are `prepareTicket`, `now` and `emit`.

All Engine methods are synchronous. Each command changes its aggregates in one transaction. `evaluateDue` uses a separate transaction for each Eval or Ticket it changes. Ports enqueue external work inside the transaction; adapters perform it after commit. Invalid requests throw `UserError`.

The Engine exposes one entry point and delegates to five internal parts. It owns each command's transaction. Commands spanning parts, such as `attach`, `evaluateDue` and `policyChanged`, call the parts in sequence.

Each part extends `EnginePart` (`src/core/part.ts`), which provides options and shared reads. Dependencies between the parts flow in one direction:

| Part | Responsibility | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Intake` | A Source's Trigger: stored once with its disposition, recorded on its Threads and their correlations, fanned out to the subscribed Tickets and, unless it is a person's message that reached one, queued for Eval on its primary Thread | Tickets |
| `Evals` | The Evals of Threads: batching, the gate's strength, actor and basis with the Trigger that gave them (`primary`), the deadline from the candidate's delivery and its shift by a pause, the requeue of an expired Eval, candidates, replays and hand-backs, the requeue on a Policy change, and the Decision each ends with: accept, stop, ignore or unavailable | Tickets |
| `Tickets` | The Ticket lifecycle: creation from an accept with its Mandate, Subscriptions and first Assignment, the Threads it follows and their closes (`followsDone`), attached Threads and Threads followed for context, Inputs and notes, resume and the messages a resume refuses, retry, restart, stop and end, the Subscriptions it drops, and the notice of a Policy change to the Tickets it bears on | Replies |
| `Assignments` | What the Executor and its workers report: an Assignment started, Inputs reached it or failed to, a restart interrupted it, and a worker's Report with its question for a person | Tickets, Replies |
| `Replies` | Channel writes through the `Outbox`: the acknowledgement, the answer, the result and the attention message, each by the rule that allows it | Nothing |

Commands use imperative names such as `stopTicket`; facts reported by adapters use past-tense names such as `assignmentStarted`. The query `candidate` uses a noun.

Callers receive only their role's `Pick` of the Engine: `EngineForSources`, `EngineForMainSession`, `EngineForPeople`, `EngineForSettings` or `EngineForExecutor`.

| Role | Method | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sources | `receive(trigger)` | Stores a Trigger once and answers `stored`, `duplicate`, or `filtered` when no Source receives it; fans it out to the Tickets subscribed to its Threads, where a person's message resumes an ended Ticket at once unless processing is paused, and queues it for Eval on its primary Thread, unless it is a person's message that reached a Ticket, which stays that Ticket's |
| Sources | `bindThread(ticketId, thread, own)` | Makes an open Ticket follow one of the Source's Threads, such as a pull request's, `own` when the Ticket opened it; a closed Thread bound again is open again. The Threads' closes, not a `ready` Report, end the Ticket |
| Sources | `threadClosed(thread, outcome, at)` | A Thread closed: each open Ticket that follows it records the close, and ends once it is done with the Threads it follows (`followsDone`): no Thread it opened is open, or, when it opened none, every Thread it follows closed. It ends `merged` or `closed` as the latest of those closes did, unless work resumed after the close has not reported `ready`, or its Executor took up, by acknowledging or answering it, a person's follow-up it decides after its latest Report other than `progress`, or the end of its last turn; a `dropped` Report then ends it as the close did |
| Main Session | `candidate(triggerId)` | The Eval that holds a Trigger, as its assessor sees it |
| Main Session | `candidateDelivered(evalId)` | The Eval's candidate reached the main Session: its deadline counts from now |
| Main Session | `decide(triggerId, outcome)` | Records an Eval Decision, or a direct Decision for an explicit request. Accept creates the Ticket, Mandate, Assignment, Subscriptions and acknowledgement atomically. An inferred candidate ignored from its card records `ignoredFromCard` before the supplied reason. While `followupOwners` still owns a human follow-up, only stop is allowed |
| Main Session | `attach(ticketId, triggerId, note?)` | Routes a Trigger to a Ticket it points at, whose Executor then decides it as a follow-up, and ends the Eval that holds it, whose other Triggers wait for a fresh Eval; an ended Ticket resumes under its Mandate at once unless processing is paused. A follow-up an Executor still decides is refused, as is one routed back to the Ticket that handed it back |
| Main Session | `requestStatus(ticketId)` | Asks a waiting Executor Session for its status, and answers whether it asked |
| Main Session | `note(ticketId, text)` | Gives a Ticket's Executor a fact from other work as a text Input, which grants nothing |
| Main Session, Executor | `reply(request)` | Queues a message for the Channel its purpose names: `acknowledgement`, `answer`, `result` or `attention` |
| People | `stopTicket(ticketId, reason?)` | A person's stop, which withdraws the Mandate |
| People | `retryTicket(ticketId)` | Ends the stalled Assignment of a Ticket that waits for a person after a `failed` or `blocked` Report, or whose Input delivery failed (`canRetry`), and starts a new one |
| People | `reevaluate(triggerId)` | Queues a stored Trigger for a fresh Eval |
| People | `unsubscribe(thread)` | Drops every Subscription on a Thread, and the Tickets that followed it follow it no more; each keeps deciding the follow-ups it received there |
| People | `dismiss(decisionId)` | Dismisses the problem an `unavailable` Decision shows, which the Decision records |
| Executor | `assignmentStarted(ticketId, assignmentId)` | An Assignment runs; its waiting Inputs go out |
| Executor | `inputsDelivered(ticketId, assignmentId, inputIds)` | Inputs reached the Assignment's Executor Session, where each waits for a step to take it |
| Executor | `inputsRead(ticketId, inputIds)` | The Executor Session took the messages that carry these Inputs into its history (a `user/message` Session event), from which its model has them; a step that claimed them and was cancelled or failed before does not count. Each counts as read once a Report or the end of a turn follows, also after a restart, and its Ticket's end does not let go of it; an Input delivered before reads were recorded counts as read once a Report or the end of a turn followed its delivery |
| Executor | `turnEnded(ticketId, assignmentId)` | A turn of the Executor Session ended, also after a Report, once nothing runs for it in the background or as it hands off to a person. What a step took before, it read (`inputsRead`) |
| Executor | `deliveryFailed(ticketId, assignmentId, error)` | Delivering Inputs failed; the Ticket shows it until a delivery succeeds, a new Assignment starts or the Ticket ends |
| Executor | `report(ticketId, report)` | Records a Report and its question for a person; `dropped` ends the Ticket, and `ready` completes one that follows no Thread, and ends one done with the Threads it follows as they ended |
| Executor | `markUnrelated(ticketId, thread, reason)` | Drops only that Ticket's Subscription to an attached Thread it found unrelated, and hands back, with the reason, the follow-ups there that the Ticket decides |
| Executor | `followForContext(ticketId, thread)` | Subscribes an open Ticket to a related Thread for context: its messages reach the Ticket but lend it no follow-up strength and do not resume it |
| Executor | `handback(ticketId, triggerId, reason)` | Records that the Ticket hands back a Trigger that reached it, with the reason its candidate carries, and queues it for a fresh Eval once no other Ticket decides it, if this Ticket did; it answers whether it queued it. A Ticket hands back each Trigger once and keeps its Subscription |
| Executor | `assignmentInterrupted(ticketId, assignmentId)` | An Assignment was running when the host stopped: one interrupted mid-work, or one that received an Input after its latest Report, starts again with a recovery note and the Inputs delivered to it that its Executor Session did not take, as a retry does; one that had reported since keeps its Session. The DshExecutor reports each at start (`resume`), oldest Ticket first, and queues again a launch that waits |
| Passes | `evaluateDue()` | Unless processing is paused: starts the Evals of the Threads whose queued Triggers wait, one per Thread with the Triggers queued meanwhile as one batch; queues the Triggers of an Eval past its deadline again, twice in a row, and records it `unavailable` the third time; and resumes the ended Tickets a person's message reached during a pause, if their Mandates still hold. An Eval whose candidate has not reached the main Session does not expire. While processing is paused, no Eval expires, and once it resumes each deadline moves later by the pause's length |
| Settings | `policyChanged(from, to, effects)` | Tells each live Ticket the change bears on how (`policyEffects` in `src/policy.ts`: a rule it was accepted under changed or no longer applies, its requester may no longer start work, or proactive work is no longer accepted), and restarts the Evals in progress under the new version |

The Engine keeps batching, authorization, fan-out, resume and attention lifecycle rules private. Several shared predicates make these rules consistent:

- `waitsForPerson` (`src/core/model.ts`): the latest Assignment reported `blocked` or `failed`, and no human message has arrived since. Automatic Inputs and failed launches remain held while this is true.
- `followupOwners`: the Tickets still responsible for a human follow-up received on their own Threads. A Ticket can be live or ended without a human stop and waiting to resume. Handing back the message ends that ownership.
- `settled`: a Decision resolved the request; stop, unavailable, routed and refused-stop Decisions do not count.
- `ticketStage` (`src/core/stage.ts`): implements the stage table in [Execution](subsystems/execution.md).

When a Ticket ends, unread follow-ups return to Eval unless another Ticket still owns them or another disposition settled them. Acknowledged, answered and handed-back messages are excluded. For older records without acknowledgement dispositions, the outbox receipt supplies that fact. A final Report also covers messages waiting when the Assignment began, including the message that resumed it. The message that stopped a Ticket is not automatically re-evaluated.

After a change, the Engine emits an event from `DomainEvents` in `src/core/ports.ts`:

`trigger.received`, `eval.started`, `decision.recorded`, `ticket.created`, `ticket.resumed`, `ticket.ended`, `assignment.started`, `assignment.ended`, `thread.subscribed`, `thread.unsubscribed`, `trigger.requeued`, or `policy.changed`.

Runtime turns `ticket.ended`, `trigger.requeued` and `thread.unsubscribed` into notices. A human `trigger.received` delivered to Tickets becomes a follow-up relay. `pullEndNotices` sends one chat notice, using a stable id, when a Ticket ends merged or closed. Other events currently have no consumer.

### Model

`src/core/model.ts` holds the domain types, and `src/core/stage.ts` the Ticket stages. A Decision records why as `reason`, a list of `Reason`s (`src/core/reasons.ts`): each a `code` with its `values` and, for one Trigger of a batch, its `triggerId`.

The core's codes, such as `timeout`, `policyChanged`, `routed` and `startedTicket`, are `REASONS`, with the English that agents read through `reasonText`; a gate or a Source scope gives its own, such as `not_a_member`; and `said` carries words an assessor or a person wrote. The panel words each code by `reason.<code>`, and a Trigger a Source filtered records the Source's code the same way.

A Ticket keeps each fact once. It is open while it has no `ended`, which records when, by whom, why and with what outcome it ended; what it last said is its latest Assignment Report (`latestReport`); and its Executor Session is named after it (`workerSessionId` in `src/executor/dsh.ts`).

Its fields are typed: `origin`, the admissible Trigger that gave its Eval's batch its strength and the batch itself (`triggerId`, `triggerIds`); `execution`, the prepared execution metadata (`name`, `directory`, `assignment` and immutable `environment` binding with `id`, `revision`, `sources`, `selectedBy`, `sourceId`, `routingRevision` and optional `reason`); `delivery`, the last failed Input delivery (`error`, `at`), until a delivery succeeds, a new Assignment starts or the Ticket ends; and `follows`, the Threads a Source made it follow, each `{thread, own, closed?}`: `own` when the Ticket opened it, and `closed` with `at` and `outcome` once it closed. Tickets alone writes `follows`; the GitHub Source reads its pull requests with `pullsOf` and `pullOf` (`src/sources/github-pull.ts`).

An Input that carries a Trigger records whether a person wrote it, which `waitsForPerson` reads. A Thread also lists in `context` the subscribed Tickets that follow it only for context, and counts in `expired` the Evals of its queued Triggers that expired in a row; an Evaluation records its `primary` Trigger and when its candidate was `delivered`.

A Trigger's disposition records the Tickets it reached, by fan-out or attachment, a person's requeue, each Ticket that handed it back, with the reason, and each Ticket whose Executor acknowledged or answered it.

A Mandate's `basis` (`MandateBasis`) records how the gate admitted its Trigger. Revalidation reads the receiving `source`, `scope` and `row`, the listed `sender`, matched `rules`, and `via`:

| `via` | Admission basis |
| --- | --- |
| `addressed` | An allowed sender addressed the agent |
| `followup` | A message arrived on a Thread with Tickets |
| `admission` | An admission-table cell; `observation` marks an inferred candidate |
| `bot` | A listed bot produced an inferred candidate |
| `listed` | A legacy basis whose sender must still be on the Source's allowed list |

Trigger and Thread `meta` belong to the Source. The core does not interpret them.

### Policy

`src/policy.ts` defines settings schemas, authorization and assessment rules. `settingsPolicy(settings, scope)` returns a fresh, stateless `Policy` on each use:

- `version`, `paused` and `evalTimeoutMs` describe its current state.
- `gate(trigger, thread, tickets)` returns admission strength and basis.
- `revalidate(mandate)` checks whether an existing Mandate still holds.
- `admitsInferred(rules)` permits proactive acceptance only in auto mode with enabled matching rules.

`assessmentOutcome(assessment, settings, strength)` converts the model's assessment to an Engine outcome. It requires a judgement for every enabled rule, settled direction, a matching rule and evidence of intent. Outside auto mode, an inferred accept becomes a “would accept” record.

`policyEffects(tickets, old, now, scope)` identifies which open Tickets a change affects and how. `Engine.policyChanged` notifies only those Tickets. `policyVersion` hashes rules, accept mode and the Sources' Policy parts, including bot lists.

### Store

`Store` (`src/app/store.ts`) owns one SQLite database. Runtime acquires the directory lock before opening it, preventing a second process from migrating or writing the same state.

Its interfaces are grouped by purpose:

- **Domain repositories:** `atomic`, plus `triggers`, `threads`, `tickets` and `decisions`, each with `get`, `save` and list queries. Indexed working sets are `threads.active()`, `tickets.open()`, `tickets.active()` and `read.subscribedThreads`.
- **Read queries:** `read` serves views, tools and Source polls through methods such as `threadTriggers`, `triggerStats`, `search` and `droppedReplies`. These methods never write.
- **Source metadata:** `threads.describe` and `threads.patchMeta` update Source-owned Thread metadata.
- **Settings:** `settings`, `saveSettings`, `blockRevision` and `settingsHistory`. Settings and prompts use numbered `Versions` (`src/app/versions.ts`).
- **Outbox receipts:** `replyStatus` and `receipts`, written only by Outbox. Receipt operations are `get`, `waiting`, `behind`, `add`, `settle` and `withdraw`. `behind` checks whether an earlier message for the same Ticket and conversation is waiting with fewer than three failures. A withdrawn message settles with `channelGone` or `channelIgnored`. Read queries expose failed and dropped replies through `failingReplies`, `droppedReplies` and `droppedSince`.
- **Typed key-value records:** `get`, `set`, `delete` and `keys`, using entries from `KV`.

`afterCommit` runs an action only after the transaction commits, never after rollback. Runtime reads records in their stored shape; startup migrates supported schema 10 records through 11 to 12. The last step moves global execution fields into `default`, adds immutable bindings without moving old directories, and marks one-time legacy preparation adoption.

### Effects

`Effects` (`src/app/effects.ts`) is the durable side-effect queue. A command calls `enqueue(kind, key, payload)` inside its transaction; execution begins only after commit.

Each kind/key pair has one row. Enqueuing the same waiting key replaces its payload and makes it due immediately without changing queue order. `handle(kind, run, options)` registers one handler per kind. It processes due rows oldest first, up to the concurrency limit.

Failures retry with exponential backoff. Throwing `Later` defers work without counting a failure, for example when no worker slot is available. `start` begins processing after setup, `drain` stops it during shutdown while preserving pending rows, and `pending`/`idle` expose queue state.

| Kind | Handler | Does | At once | Retry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `assessment` | MasterAssessor | Steers an Eval's candidate card into the main Session's turn, then tells the Engine it was delivered, which starts the Eval's deadline | 4, none while paused | 2 s doubling to 60 s |
| `launch` | DshExecutor | Launches a pending Assignment: prepare command, Executor Session, assignment message | The free worker slots, none while paused | A passing failure of the model provider or the network runs again after 5 s doubling to 300 s, three times; any other failure, and a failed prepare command, fails its Ticket. One held by a pause or by full worker slots tries again after 5 s |
| `delivery` | DshExecutor | Hands a Ticket's waiting Inputs to its running Assignment, in order | 4, none while paused | 2 s doubling to 60 s; one that waits for a worker slot tries again after 2 s |
| `relay` | Sessions | Steers a worker's report or question, or a person's follow-up, into the main Session's turn | 1, in queue order | 2 s doubling to 60 s |
| `notice` | Sessions | Injects a notice into the main Session without waking it | 1, in queue order | 2 s doubling to 60 s |
| `reply` | Outbox | Sends a message for a Channel through its Source, after the earlier messages of its Ticket to its conversation that have not failed three times; withdrawing the message cancels it | 1, none while paused | 5 s doubling to 300 s; one whose Source is off, or behind an earlier message, tries again after 5 s |

Each kind has a health entry under its name. It reports an error once one of its effects failed three times in a row, except `delivery`, whose failures show on their Ticket instead. Relays keep their order, and so do notices; a failed one holds back the later ones of its kind.

### Sources

Sources extend the host through `SourceKind`, defined in `src/sources/kind.ts`. A kind declares its identity, title, description, configuration `schema` and `fields`, derived `facts`, and `health` entries. Optional behavior includes `scope`, a `channel` (`allowed`, `send`, `link`), `threadContext`, `find`, `policy`, `environment` and `refreshLabels`.

`SourceRegistry` (`registry.ts`) owns registered kinds separately from stable instance ids and implements the Engine's `SourceScope`. Registration claims each instance's health entries on `HealthBoard`; duplicate claims and reserved `sync:` names are refused. Legacy instance ids keep their original names; another instance uses its id for the kind's main entry and `<id>:<entry>` for other entries. A SourceContext writes only through its registration's claimed entries, so reports after unregistration do nothing.

Registry configuration methods include `kind`, `instances`, `instance`, `validate`, `validatePolicy`, `policyPart`, `channelAllowed`, `declarations`, `environments`, `find` and `scope`. `find` asks each kind that supports search.

Generic code accesses Source behavior through the registry. `send(message, commands)` calls the kind's Channel and returns `sent`, `gone` or `waiting` if the kind is not installed. `link` resolves its Channel link. `threadContext` pairs a kind's reader with its configuration, or returns nothing when the kind has no reader. Invalid stored configuration disables the instance.

Plugins receive `SourceHost`: the registry and `context(kind, id?)`, with the kind's id as the legacy default. The kind itself uses a narrower `SourceContext`, built by `sourceContextOf` in `src/app/source-context.ts`. GitHub and Feishu run one loop per configured instance.

That context supplies stable `id` and `kind`, instance-specific deployment and Commands, setup readiness (`ready`, `configured`, `problem`), configuration, `receive`, `atomic`, and typed `state`. Named-instance state is namespaced while legacy instances retain old cursor keys. Ingestion refuses another instance's Trigger. It also exposes Thread reads and metadata writes, Ticket reads and binding/closure commands, Trigger reads, `notify` through Outbox, and `report` for declared health entries. Replies use the stored Channel's exact instance; they never select an account from the Ticket's newest incoming Source or from a global default.

Each context captures a generation signature of its kind and the fields in `SETUP_FIELDS`: currently the GitHub repository and CLI, and the Feishu CLI. A change to those fields or Runtime shutdown makes the old context inactive: configuration/readiness no longer admits its work, state-changing operations reject late results with `AbortError`, and health writes become no-ops. Other configuration, including polling and listening settings, remains live within that generation. A custom kind's connection-defining fields need their own setup and generation handling before relying on cancellation after a connection edit. A Worker context uses its immutable snapshot revision as the generation instead of the live Source connection, preserving an existing Ticket's binding across Source edits.

### Environments and scoped subprocesses

`Environments` ([environments.ts](../src/app/environments.ts)) separates execution selection from admission Policy. `candidates(trigger)` offers only the Source's fixed target or explicit allowlist, with non-secret purpose/repository summaries and a routing revision. `repositorySource` scopes assessment repository reads without binding a Ticket. `bind(ticket, outcome)` validates the selected id, revision, availability and repository compatibility inside the acceptance transaction, persists the immutable snapshot/account facts and returns execution metadata for the Engine to save.

The snapshot revision hashes the concrete root, environment config and raw Source connection references. `KV.execution.snapshot` stores that config; `KV.execution.accounts` stores the separately resolved identities once. `snapshot`, `assertEnabled`, `deployment` and `resolve` read the pinned revision. Current routing changes affect only later accepts; current explicit disable is checked again before execution. A missing binding or snapshot fails rather than falling back to today's `default`.

`bind` compares the current Setup-verified identity with any existing account record for that revision. Each `resolve` compares a matching startup-verified Source identity when available; a historical reference not covered by current setup is explicitly probed once per Runtime before use, coalescing concurrent probes. Failed or mismatching probes are not cached as verified. `environmentAccountChanged` refuses a mismatch without overwriting saved facts. Identity comparison uses GitHub's canonical repository, resolved CLI, login and no-reply email, and Feishu's resolved CLI, app id, brand and bot id; display names are not identity. The timing and security limits of those checks remain recorded under D24 in [Implementation status](status.md#design-obligations).

[worker-environment.ts](../src/infra/worker-environment.ts), exported as `./worker-environment`, mounts twice. The bundle isolates the existing subprocess provider into a native realm; capture mode exposes that exact provider, and overlay mode registers `WorkerEnvironmentScope` and `WorkerSubprocess` in the Host realm. The decorator preserves the native process/PTY interface, cwd, argv and stdio while applying the scoped environment and its own lifetime cleanup. It tracks only handles admitted through that decorator, joins their process ranges during disposal, and does not terminate calls made directly through the captured native provider. `AsyncLocalStorage` wraps the actual tool-dispatch continuation, so concurrent Workers, nested subagents and shell closures from shared presets retain the right overlay. Exact-Agent bindings cover attributed non-tool operations. `workerTicketId` resolves live or persisted parent lineage.

The overlay does not mutate `process.env`. Revision-specific shim/config materialization belongs to [environment.ts](../src/infra/environment.ts). Its in-flight/success cache is scoped to the Runtime's `AbortSignal`: calls in one lifetime share a revision, failed attempts are evicted, and a fresh Runtime rebuilds and verifies it again. A pre-aborted request writes nothing. Missing bundle composition refuses Worker execution. Subprocess deletion tombstones cannot always be represented by the current strings-only PTY API; bound terminal requests fail closed when required removals cannot be honored. These are default-path guardrails, not OS isolation.

### DshExecutor

`DshExecutor` (`src/executor/dsh.ts`) provides one Session and directory per Ticket. `start` and `deliver` enqueue `launch` and `delivery` effects. `stop` cancels the turn through `Store.afterCommit`, so a rolled-back end does not stop the worker.

`prepare(ticket, outcome)` supplies the Engine's `prepareTicket` hook through the environment binder: short name, immutable directory/binding and `ticketExecution` assignment text. `workerSessionId(ticket.id)` derives the Session id. Launch resolves the pinned environment, prepares with its overlay and records `KV.execution.prepared` only after command and git checks succeed. Migration grants a legacy marker only for historically started/used Assignments; after directory checks it is consumed into a normal marker. Failure before execution started does not make a partial directory adoptable.

`WorkerSlots` reserves capacity before a launch or a delivery that wakes an idle worker. A human message can use one slot beyond `maxWorkers`, and wakes have priority over launches. `activeCount` supplies panel load.

Transient provider and network failures get three retries. Launches use effect backoff; failed turns receive continuation messages after 15, 30 and 60 seconds. `inputMessage` renders each Input from current Ticket state, and `mandateInstructions` adds the matched-rule limits for inferred work.

`install` subscribes to Session events; `dispose` unsubscribes. A turn end normally reports waiting, except after readiness or while human action is required. Errors report failed. At startup, `resume` reports interrupted Assignments through `assignmentInterrupted` and requeues pending launches that do not wait for a person, oldest Ticket first.

### MasterAssessor

`MasterAssessor` (`src/app/assessment.ts`) lets the main Session assess proactive candidates. `request` queues an assessment effect; `release` drops cached state when its Eval ends.

Its `context`, `read` and `decide` methods serve `orchestrator_eval`, `orchestrator_eval_read` and `orchestrator_eval_decide`. They provide bounded Thread context through `SourceRegistry.threadContext`, repository context, and decision submission. A kind without a context reader supplies only the Trigger and batch.

`assessmentOutcome` converts the model's answer for `Engine.decide`. Evals checks inferred acceptance against the current Policy again.

### Settings

`Settings` (`src/app/settings.ts`) reads and writes revisioned settings blocks. `current` and `view` read them; `save(block, value, revision, origin)` validates a save; `pause(paused, origin)` changes the separate `paused` setting.

Every save declares its origin: `panel`, `tool` or `sync`. Only `panel` can change `environment:<id>`, Source execution selection or fields listed in `SETUP_FIELDS` (`src/deployment.ts`). Source saves carry a reusable `kind` separately from the block's instance id. Validation checks all environment/Source references again after asynchronous account checks and refuses repurposing a durable Source's kind or GitHub repository. `executor` holds only model and shared concurrency.

A Policy-version change calculates `policyEffects`, records which Tickets were notified, and calls `Engine.policyChanged`. `syncable` and `sync(id)` refresh a Source's Policy part. `refreshLabels(id)` refreshes display names.

### Prompts

`Prompts` (`src/app/prompts.ts`) stores configurations as `Versions`. `current`, `version` and `history` read them; `validate`, `preview` and `save(value, baseRevision, source)` check and save them. `compose` and `skills` build Session text.

`builtInParts` lists override keys, roles, default text and required template placeholders. Each override stores team `text` and a `base`: the `builtInBase` key of its original default. Saves preserve that default under `KV.prompts.builtIn`. `defaultChanged` then reports changed defaults, their old text when available, and removed parts.

Validation inherits an omitted base from the saved override, drops removed parts already present in saved data, and rejects blank text or other unknown keys. This allows the save tool to round-trip a configuration it read. `environmentSection` and `policySection` substitute template values once, using own keys only. Configurations without overrides use defaults.

### Sessions

`Sessions` (`src/app/sessions.ts`) manages DeepSeek Harness Sessions for both roles. `ensure` creates a Session with its role's model. `install` follows agent events and registers prompts, skills and tools for managed Sessions.

`prompt` delivers once per request id. `relay` and `notify` enqueue main-Session messages handled by the `relay` and `notice` effects. `src/app/notices.ts` defines their content; `delivery` checks whether a message arrived.

Each model request binds the Session to the current prompt revision. The revisions it used are stored durably: `promptVersion` identifies the active one and `mayRead` restricts which versions a worker can inspect. Registrations are tracked in one map per agent.

`status` and `promptVersion` serve prompt pages. Saves go through `Prompts.save` and notify the main Session. `modelRetry` exposes model-budget retry state.

### Glue

| Glue | Translates |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app/runtime.ts` | The composition root: builds the parts with the interfaces they use, registers the routes and the Source host, and starts and stops dsh-superagent |
| `src/app/notices.ts` | Domain events and worker reports into notices and relays for the main Session |
| `src/app/tools/main.ts`, `src/app/tools/executor.ts` | Tool arguments of the main Session and the Executor Sessions into calls of the core classes, and their results into cards |
| `src/app/http.ts`, `src/app/views/`, `src/app/api.ts` | HTTP requests into calls, and Store reads into the panel's views; `api.ts` types every route for the panel |
| `src/app/resources.ts`, `src/app/links.ts`, `src/app/cards.ts` | Resource names into reads, source messages into links, records into compact cards for models |
| `src/sources/github*.ts`, `src/sources/feishu*.ts`, `src/sources/poll.ts` | GitHub and Feishu payloads into Triggers and Thread facts, and messages into CLI calls |
| `src/deployment.ts`, `src/setup.ts`, `src/infra/` | Setup probes and problems, instance-scoped CLI transport and immutable Worker subprocess environments |

## Dependency rules

- **Explicit, narrow dependencies.** Each class receives an interface that names what it uses, mostly as `Pick` types of other classes: `ExecutorHost`, `AssessorHost`, `SessionsHost`, `SettingsHost`, `SetupHost`, `PassesHost` and `OutboxHost` for the core classes, and `HttpHost`, `MainToolsHost`, `ExecutorToolsHost`, `ResourceHost`, `LinkHost` and `SourceContextDeps` for the glue, with the Engine as the `Pick` of the role that calls it. The Runtime passes itself only behind such an interface. A Source plugin injects the `orchestrator` service, which its type names as a `SourceHost`: the registry and `context(kind, id?)`; each instance's code sees only its `SourceContext`.
- **What may import what.** `src/core` imports nothing outside itself apart from Node's hashing, and does no I/O. `src/sources` imports nothing from `src/app`. The panel imports only types from the host side, and the plain values of `src/admission.ts`, `src/limits.ts`, `src/setup.ts`, `src/navigation.ts`, `src/sources/host.ts`, `src/core/errors.ts`, `src/core/reasons.ts` and the filter lists of `src/app/api.ts`.
- **One writer per state.** Each kind of state has one writer, and the others read it or ask that writer.

  | State | Writer |
  | --- | --- |
  | Triggers, Threads, Decisions, Tickets, Assignments | Engine |
  | A Source's read positions, and the meta it keeps on its Threads (`label`, `url`, `facts` and its own keys) | That Source, through `SourceContext` |
  | Settings and their history | Settings |
  | Prompt versions | Prompts |
  | Immutable execution snapshots and resolved account facts | Environments; startup migration seeds legacy snapshots |
  | Ticket preparation markers | DshExecutor after success; startup migration seeds one-time legacy markers |
  | Effect rows | Effects |
  | Outbox receipts | The Outbox: the Engine's messages and Sources' `notify` go through its `send`, and its `reply` effects mark them |
  | A health entry | The part that claimed it on the `HealthBoard` (`src/infra/health.ts`), which refuses a second claim: `runtime` the Runtime, which Passes report through, `evals` the Runtime after each pass, `models` Sessions, each effect kind Effects, `worker` the DshExecutor, a Source kind's entries the SourceRegistry for that kind's Source, `sync:<id>` Settings |

  A Source changes a Ticket only through `SourceContext.tickets.bindThread` and `threadClosed`, which call the Engine.
- **Requests and facts.** A method that asks for something is named by an imperative verb and its object, such as `stopTicket` or `bindThread`, and may be refused; a method that records what an adapter did is named in the past tense, such as `assignmentStarted` or `deliveryFailed`. Each host receives the Engine as the role type it needs.
- **Typed fields, and Source data under the Source.** The code reads typed fields of Tickets and Mandates. A Source keeps nothing on a Ticket: which of its Threads a Ticket follows is the Ticket's `follows`, and what it keeps about a Trigger or a Thread is in their `meta`.
- **Fixed refusals.** A refusal a person or an agent can cause is a `UserError(code, values)` from `USER_ERRORS` in `src/core/errors.ts`. The management API answers a `missing` code with 404 and the others with 400, and the panel words each code in its language. Setup problems are `SetupError` codes (`src/setup.ts`) and fixed health texts `HealthCode`s (`src/sources/host.ts`), worded the same way.
### Source-specific dependencies

Some generic modules still refer directly to GitHub or Feishu:

- Outbox applies the Feishu chat word limit.
- `src/app/links.ts` resolves Feishu message links and `repliedTo`. It and Runtime read settings with `feishuSettings`.
- `src/app/resources.ts` reads the `feishu/` and `github/` originals; `src/app/cards.ts` uses `pullOf` for Ticket cards.
- Runtime sends `pullEndNotices` for merged or closed Tickets.
- Executor tools bind reported pull requests with `readPull` and `claimPull`, using the GitHub context exposed by Runtime.
- MasterAssessor reads repository files with `readRepositoryPath`.
- Sessions and Prompts register built-in skills only for GitHub and Feishu. Migration converts their schema-10 records.
- Setup probes only GitHub and Feishu account fields (`SETUP_FIELDS`). Only those Sources receive account setup problems through `SourceContext.problem`.

| `src/sources/github.ts` | The GitHub kind and plugin entry, exported as `./github-watch`: a poll round of notifications, the pull requests of open Tickets with their CI, and subscribed Threads |
| `src/sources/github-trigger.ts` | GitHub comments, reviews, Issue bodies and CI changes as Triggers, and GitHub addresses |
| `src/sources/github-pull.ts` | The pull request rules: which pull requests a Ticket follows (`claimPull`, `observePull`), the closes it reports to the Engine, and `pullEndNotices`, the chat notice of a Ticket that ended merged or closed |
| `src/sources/github-channel.ts` | The GitHub Channel: comments and review thread replies, `sent` or `gone` |
| `src/sources/github-read.ts` | CI snapshots, repository reads, the `github/` resources, and `githubThreadContext`: an Issue's or pull request's conversation by page |

| `src/sources/feishu-read.ts` | The `feishu/` reads of a Trigger's message, its root, parent and topic, and `feishuThreadContext`, which gives them to assessments with their images |
| `src/sources/admission-context.ts` | The bounded window an assessment starts from: the first pages of a Trigger's Thread, read through its kind, and the messages around the Trigger |
| `src/sources/feishu-image.ts` | Reads a Feishu message's image as an attachment for the assessing Session |
| `src/client/index.tsx` | The client plugin entry: the sidebar entry, the main panel and the page in DeepSeek Harness's Plugin Manager |
| `src/client/app.tsx` | The panel: header, search, glossary, tabs and the page of the current route |
| `src/client/provider.tsx` | What every page reads from its host: copy, calls, navigation, notices, the state poll, and `restart`, which reads the state quickly while dsh-superagent restarts |
| `src/client/api.ts` | Calls and polls of the management API, typed by `src/app/api.ts`, and the Decision filters of the Eval status |
| `src/client/route.ts` | The tabs, the settings groups, the typed routes that `parseRoute` reads, and the route memory with the settings group opened last |
| `src/client/overview.tsx` | The overview |
| `src/client/session-view.tsx` | The Session overview: verifies Ticket ownership and reuses its detail page |
| `src/client/source.tsx`, `trigger.tsx`, `eval.tsx`, `execution.tsx` | One file per stage: its status, and its settings where it has some |

| `src/client/prompts.tsx` | The Prompts settings: the page owns the view it read and its editor the draft, and the Edit, Full prompt and History tabs render from them; a built-in part's editor shows a changed default and keeps or drops the override |
| `src/client/prompt-config.ts` | The prompt configuration by section, by the team sections, skill names, built-in parts (`part/<key>`, with `withOverride`) and part headings the prompt views give, and the line diff of the full prompt, as pure functions |
| `src/client/deployment.tsx` | The Deployment settings, also shown in DeepSeek Harness's Plugin Manager |
| `src/client/draft.tsx` | Settings drafts: `draftReducer`, their states and their merge with a newer saved revision, `saveBarText`, the save bar's line, and the save bar |
| `src/client/controls.tsx` | Local copies of DeepSeek Harness's controls, which follow its markup, keyboard behaviour and design tokens, since the bundle does not import `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`; they read no context |
| `src/client/widgets.tsx` | The small components the pages share, which read the panel's context: sections, page heads, load states, times, links, confirmed actions, the setup check and Markdown |
| `src/client/rows.tsx` | The rows the pages share: a Ticket, a Thread and a Decision, a Thread's chip, and the folding of runs of automated messages |
| `src/client/markdown.ts` | The Markdown subset of reports and questions, and the bare addresses in messages, as blocks and inline parts |
| `src/client/text.ts` | Copy by key and the wording of domain values, reasons, senders and times |
| `src/client/marks.ts` | The marks of the states the views classify: a Ticket's or a Thread's stage, a Source's state and a Decision's outcome, each as a dot, an icon, a tone and a label |

| `src/client/client.css`, `css.d.ts` | The panel's stylesheet, loaded as text |

`src/sources/github.ts` and `src/sources/feishu.ts` are also the entries of the two Source plugins, built by `tsdown.config.ts` and exported in `package.json` as `./github-watch` and `./feishu-watch`. The bundle inserts the main and Source plugins, with Feishu disabled, and mounts the `./worker-environment` helper in capture and overlay modes around the existing native subprocess provider. It defines the worker/router presets as part of the same composition.

## Open questions

These are open questions of this implementation. Open questions of the design itself are listed in [the design](design.md) and are not answered by this document.

- Trust: which Trigger fields are trusted, such as the Source's actor and Thread membership, and which are not, such as the body and quotes.
- Deployment isolation: the agent's profile on its own pinned DeepSeek Harness installation, so upgrading DeepSeek Harness elsewhere does not break it.
